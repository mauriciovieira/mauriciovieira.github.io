<p>"Yes. Again. This time I will do it!". Here I go with another technical blog. The main reason is that I don't want to pay Dreamhost anymore, so I decided to use Github pages.</p>

<p>This blog is meant to be a <i>daily</i> blog with short posts for whatever I do or read. I want to make my personal goals public, because that is supposed to make me more engaged to finish them. I also want to have it in portuguese, with a separate index, for posting old notes that I wrote in txt and never published.<p>

<h2 class="section-heading">September goal</h2>

There's a <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">post</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jeresig">John Resig</a> that inspires me a lot. He says there that he'll code everyday, and sets his own rules. And I think he's been coding everyday since that blog post.

What I want to do for September is just <b>blog everyday</b>. Simple like that. Let's see how it goes.
