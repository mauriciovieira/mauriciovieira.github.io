[Ruth](http://rumyrashead.com/)'s talk was about [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI). She introduced [Cameron's World](http://www.cameronsworld.net/) to say it's not MIDI but digital audio. 

She was the second speaker to mention the poo emoji (ðŸ’©), and actually she played the emoji (that is a 4 characters UTF-8 word) as midi on her talk.

I found her talk on [JSConf Uruguay](https://jsconf.uy/) too:

(and on [Web progressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2v3mQOvOms))

But couldn't find the slides on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/rumyra)
